# Introduction
Welcome to my GitHub repository! ðŸš€

This repository houses all of my implementations for the web application development projects I've undertaken during my time at university. From frontend designs to backend functionalities, this collection showcases my journey through various web development challenges and assignments.

Each project folder contains the codebase, documentation, and any additional resources related to that particular assignment. Whether it's building interactive user interfaces, integrating databases, or deploying applications, you'll find a diverse range of web development skills demonstrated here.

Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or even contribute. Let's continue to learn and grow together in the world of web development!

Happy coding! ðŸ’»âœ¨
